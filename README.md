# opencv-basics

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture, and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.

Let us discuss some image processing operations in OpenCV.
